Evolution is a computer generated simulation of the matter-energy timeline since the creation of our galaxy.
Phases of creation of visible matter:
Superdense matter in massive blackhole in the galactic center(Condensed form of cosmic energy)-->
-->Hidden phases of galactic evolution- crystallization of elementary particles-->
-->Explosion of the galactic egg:creation of:Cosmic Lattice and visible matter(Static 0. E{E=mcc} and Dynamic 0. E{resp. EM Fields})-->
-->Creation of light elements and heavy elements(in stars).
Components of visible matter:
Structure of the electron as oscilating system(Oscilation energy)-->
-->Atoms with z>2 and moew with 1 electron(Intrinsic energy)-->
-->Atomic rings in biomolecules(Energy of rotating quantum state)-->
-->Protein and DNA(Biofield. Energy storage mechanism and release)-->
-->Brain(Information Field. Energy storage for memory).
