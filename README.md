Evolution is a computer generated simulation of the matter-energy timeline since the creation of our galaxy.<br />
Phases of creation of visible matter:<br />
Superdense matter in massive blackhole in the galactic center(Condensed form of cosmic energy)--><br />
-->Hidden phases of galactic evolution- crystallization of elementary particles--><br />
-->Explosion of the galactic egg: creation of: Cosmic Lattice and visible matter(Static 0. E{E=mcc} and Dynamic 0. E{resp. EM Fields})--><br />
-->Creation of light elements and heavy elements(in stars).<br />
Components of visible matter:<br />
Structure of the electron as oscilating system(Oscilation energy)--><br />
-->Atoms with z>2 and moew with 1 electron(Intrinsic energy)--><br />
-->Atomic rings in biomolecules(Energy of rotating quantum state)--><br />
-->Protein and DNA(Biofield. Energy storage mechanism and release)--><br />
-->Brain(Information Field. Energy storage for memory).
